# Can you hack your government?

Vulnerability disclosure policies and bug bounty programs are becoming standard across companies and governments. Beginning with the U.S. Department of Defense, several government agencies worldwide have implemented vulnerability disclosure programs.

This is a list of government agencies that have bug bounty programs or vulnerability disclosure policies. Please reach out if any government agencies are missing from this list.

Note: This list is not an invitation to hack any of the listed organizations. Ensure that you comply with all listed terms of an organization's vulnerability disclosure policy.
